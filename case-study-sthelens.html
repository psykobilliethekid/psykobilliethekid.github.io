        <div class="col-md-6">
          <p class="text-justify">A few hours before leaving for Magfest, a retro video-game convention held in National Harbor, Maryland, a friend asked if I could take a look at her parent's website for their stables to see if I could come up with a new design. I loved working on this site since it's not just a stable but a place for older and younger horses to relax with their owners and run freely on their pastures. </p>

          <p class="text-justify">Task: Redesign website for local horse stable<br>Tools: Pencil and paper, Adobe Photoshop, Bootstrap 3, Font Awesome, StartBootstrap.com</p>

          <p class="text-justify">My goal for this site was to make sure their services would be the main draw to the user, followed by easy to find directions to their stables, and an overview of their services for their clients. The current site is divided up into several pages, each highlighting an aspect of the stables as well as providing contact information and a Google Map for driving directions. I gained they wanted to have the same goal as the DNJ site: clean but effective and informative. </p>

          <p class="text-justify">I started out sketching the functionalty of the site, focusing mainly on the mobile use for the user since I belive many people would be viewing this information with their mobile device during, just after, or while on break from riding or working in the stables. I wanted a clean design again, with a focus on their services and their contact information. </p>

          <p class="text-justify">I wanted to save time and not re-invent the wheel with this one, so I went to StartBootstrap.com to find a template that would effectively display their information and would be easy to edit from the developer's end. Adding in the informaiton for the site was simple, with a few changes made for their services, where I placed like-with-like under an image from their stables. </p>

          <p class="text-justify">I prototyped the site in Bootstrap first, and throughlly tested its mobile views before moving on to each additional section. I added in the horses running as the header image to give the user a sense of excitement and freedom when first seeing the site, since that is something the stable owners want to encourage. I used Font-Awesome to add the leaf branch next to the site name just to give it a little focus, while the images for the services really grab the viewers attention. </p>

          <p class="text-justify">My friend loves the new look of the site, (and isn't just saying that to be nice too!) and has passed it on to her parents for final approval. I'll update this as soon as I receive some feeback. </p>      

          <p class="text-justify">I guess the challenging part of this entire projct was getting their idea of freedom, relaxation, and openness conveyed to the user. The owners want to make sure people know this is a “drama free” zone where horses and horse owners can seek the relaxation and care they need from others who have the same ideals. Condensing this all into one page with a clean appearance with a challenge I feel I was able to do well, since I had to go over several pages on the original site and place them together like an intricate puzzle. But again, my main focus was to draw attention to thier services so the user can scan for what they are looking for and easily find that information.</p>
