        <div class="col-md-6">
          <p class="text-justify">I came across this project when I interviewed at this local shop for a part-time register position. It really is funny how you come across some opportunities when you least expect it.</p>

          <p class="text-justify">Task: Redesign the website of a local small business<br>Tools: WordPress, Photoshop</p>

          <p class="text-justify">This was one of my three projects completed during my year of freelance work. I was not complete confident in my coding skills, so I relized on ThemeForest to provide the WordPress template for the site, and made the edits where needed for the customer.</p>

          <p class="text-justify">The original site was a static HTML site made with tables and some images. I used WordPress and the Church 22 theme from ThemeForest to add in intractivity to the site, promote many of the events happening at the store, and set up a blog for posts and comments on events.</p>

          <p class="text-justify">I also aided the owner in creating the logo used for the new site â€“ a simple design I came up with in Photoshop while changing around some of the Filter settings. Again, the interesting things that happen when you least expect it.</p>

          <p class="text-justify">I guess the hardest parts of this project would have been working on the WordPress theme with the theme author and doing the administrative side of freelance work. Like I mentioned earlier, I was not confident in my coding skills at the time, especially since I was still in school when I was working on this site. So I was able to work with the theme's creator, who was very responsive with his emails and patient with my questions, and was able to manipulate the theme to the specifications the store owner wanted. I also learned how much patience I can have when trying to contact a client and get the content you need to in order to complete a site on time. This was around the time I also found out I liked making sites more than I liked the administrative side of the business.</p>

          <p class="text-justify">To each his own.</p>
